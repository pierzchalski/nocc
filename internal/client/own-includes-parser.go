// As a result, we have all dependencies, just like the C++ preprocessor was invoked.

// Unlike `cxx -M`, this is not a preprocessor, so it does nothing about #ifdef etc.
// Hence, it can find more includes than `cxx -M`, some of them may not exist, especially in system headers.
// This is not an error, because in practice, they are likely to be surrounded with #ifdef and never reached.
// But if own includes parsed finds fewer dependencies than `cxx -M`, it's a bug.
//
// Own includes can work only if paths are statically resolved: it can do nothing about #include MACRO().
// For instance, it can't analyze boost, as it's full of macro-includes.
